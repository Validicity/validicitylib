# Validicitylib
This is a shared Dart library for the different parts of the system that are written in Dart:

* Validicityserver - Server side main component in Dart
* Validicityclient - NFC scanner client in Dart

This repository should typically be cloned out right next to the other clones since we use a relative path (like "../validicitylib") to refer to this library.
